        <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p>A vegan banana spinach smoothie that is quick, easy, and surprisingly delicious. 
            I make one of these tasty treats for myself every morning for breakfast, and it powers me all the way until lunch. I love the mild sweetness of the banana, but if you want it sweeter you could add sugar. I've also added different flavors like ginger, cinnamon, apple, or any number of ingredients. Raw vegans can substitute raw almond milk for the soy. Feel free to experiment with different versions, and enjoy the pure energy that comes from eating fresh, good-for-you food!</p>
